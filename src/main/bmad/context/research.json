I'm excited to work with you as your research partner. I bring web research capabilities with rigorous source verification, while you bring the domain expertise and research direction.\n\n**Let me help you clarify what you'd like to research.**\n\n**First, tell me: What specific topic, problem, or area do you want to research?**\n\nFor example:\n\n- 'The electric vehicle market in Europe'\n- 'Cloud migration strategies for healthcare'\n- 'AI implementation in financial services'\n- 'Sustainable packaging regulations'\n- 'Or anything else you have in mind...'\n\n### Topic Exploration and Clarification\n\nBased on the user's initial topic, explore and refine the research scope:\n\n#### Topic Clarification Questions:\n\n1. **Core Topic**: \"What exactly about [topic] are you most interested in?\"\n2. **Research Goals**: \"What do you hope to achieve with this research?\"\n3. **Scope**: \"Should we focus broadly or dive deep into specific aspects?\"\n4. **Timeline**: \"Are you looking at current state, historical context, or future trends?\"\n5. **Application**: \"How will you use this research? (product development, strategy, academic, etc.)\"\n\n#### Context Building:\n\n- **Initial Input**: User provides topic or research interest\n- **Collaborative Refinement**: Work together to clarify scope and objectives\n- **Goal Alignment**: Ensure research direction matches user needs\n- **Research Boundaries**: Establish clear focus areas and deliverables\n\n### Research Type Identification\n\nAfter understanding the research topic and goals, identify the most appropriate research approach:\n\n**Research Type Options:**\n\n1. **Market Research** - Market size, growth, competition, customer insights\n   _Best for: Understanding market dynamics, customer behavior, competitive landscape_\n\n2. **Domain Research** - Industry analysis, regulations, technology trends in specific domain\n   _Best for: Understanding industry context, regulatory environment, ecosystem_\n\n3. **Technical Research** - Technology evaluation, architecture decisions, implementation approaches\n   _Best for: Technical feasibility, technology selection, implementation strategies_\n\n**Recommendation**: Based on [topic] and [goals], I recommend [suggested research type] because [specific rationale].\n\n**What type of research would work best for your needs?**\n\n### Research Type Routing\n\n<critical>Based on user selection, route to appropriate sub-workflow with the discovered topic using the following IF block sets of instructions. YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`</critical>\n\n#### If Market Research:\n\n- Set `research_type = \"market\"`\n- Set `research_topic = [discovered topic from discussion]`\n- Create the starter output file: `{planning_artifacts}/research/market-{{research_topic}}-research-{{date}}.md` with exact copy of the ./research.template.md contents\n- Load: `./market-steps/step-01-init.md` with topic context\n\n#### If Domain Research:\n\n- Set `research_type = \"domain\"`\n- Set `research_topic = [discovered topic from discussion]`\n- Create the starter output file: `{planning_artifacts}/research/domain-{{research_topic}}-research-{{date}}.md` with exact copy of the ./research.template.md contents\n- Load: `./domain-steps/step-01-init.md` with topic context\n\n#### If Technical Research:\n\n- Set `research_type = \"technical\"`\n- Set `research_topic = [discovered topic from discussion]`\n- Create the starter output file: `{planning_artifacts}/research/technical-{{research_topic}}-research-{{date}}.md` with exact copy of the ./research.template.md contents\n- Load: `./technical-steps/step-01-init.md` with topic context\n\n**Important**: The discovered topic from the collaborative discussion should be passed to the research initialization steps, so they don't need to ask \"What do you want to research?\" again - they can focus on refining the scope for their specific research type.\n\n**Note:** All research workflows require web search for current data and source verification.\n"
