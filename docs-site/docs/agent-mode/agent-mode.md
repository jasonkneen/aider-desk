# Agent Mode Overview

Agent Mode in AiderDesk transforms the application into a powerful, autonomous assistant capable of handling complex software engineering tasks. Powered by the Vercel AI SDK, the agent can plan, reason, and utilize a suite of tools to achieve its goals with minimal human intervention.

## Key Capabilities

- **Autonomous Task Execution**: The agent can break down a high-level request (e.g., "refactor the authentication logic") into a series of concrete steps.
- **Tool Utilization**: It can use a wide range of tools, including built-in Power Tools for file system operations, Aider Tools for code manipulation, and external tools via MCP Servers.
- **Configurable Profiles**: Tailor the agent's behavior, capabilities, and LLM settings for different tasks using Agent Profiles.
- **Transparent Operation**: Observe the agent's thought process, the tools it chooses, and the results of its actions directly in the chat interface.
