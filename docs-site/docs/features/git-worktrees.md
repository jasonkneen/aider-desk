# Git Worktrees

AiderDesk's Git Worktrees feature provides a powerful, isolated development environment that allows you to work on multiple features or experiments simultaneously without affecting your main project branch. This feature leverages Git's native worktree functionality to create separate working directories while sharing the same repository history.

## Overview

Git worktrees enable you to:

- **Work in Isolation**: Create separate working directories for each task or feature
- **Preserve Main Branch**: Keep your main project directory clean and stable
- **Switch Context Easily**: Move between different worktrees without losing progress
- **Safe Experimentation**: Test changes without risking your main codebase
- **Flexible Integration**: Choose how to integrate changes back to target branches

## How It Works

When you create a task with worktree mode enabled, AiderDesk:

1. **Creates a Worktree**: Generates a new working directory at `.aider-desk/tasks/{taskId}/worktree`
2. **Isolates Changes**: All file modifications, commits, and AI interactions happen within this worktree
3. **Maintains Connection**: The worktree shares the same Git repository history but has its own working state
4. **Preserves Main**: Your main project directory remains untouched until you explicitly merge changes

## Working Modes

Each task in AiderDesk can operate in one of two modes:

### Local Mode
- Works directly in your main project directory
- Traditional workflow where changes affect the main branch immediately
- Suitable for quick fixes and simple changes

### Worktree Mode
- Creates an isolated environment for the task
- All changes are contained within the worktree
- Requires explicit merge to integrate changes back to main
- Ideal for complex features, experiments, and parallel development

## Worktree Workflow

### 1. Creating a Worktree Task

![Worktree Creation](../images/worktree-creation.gif)

1. **Create New Task**: Click "New Task" in the project interface
2. **Select Worktree Mode**: Choose the worktree icon (🌿) instead of local mode (📁)
3. **Automatic Setup**: AiderDesk automatically creates the worktree and switches to it

### 2. Working in the Worktree

Once in worktree mode:

- **Isolated Environment**: All file edits, AI prompts, and commits happen in the worktree
- **Full Git Functionality**: You can commit, branch, and use all Git features within the worktree
- **AI Integration**: Aider operates within the worktree context, unaware of the isolation
- **Context Management**: Context files are managed relative to the worktree directory

### 3. Integration Options

When you're ready to integrate your worktree changes, AiderDesk provides enhanced integration options with flexible target branch selection:

#### Option 1: Standard Merge
- **Process**: Rebase worktree onto target branch, then fast-forward merge
- **Result**: Preserves all individual commits from the worktree
- **Use Case**: When you want to maintain detailed commit history
- **Command**: `git merge --ff-only`
- **Customization**: Choose any target branch and optional custom commit message

#### Option 2: Squash & Merge
- **Process**: Rebase worktree onto target branch, then squash into single commit
- **Result**: Creates one clean commit with AI-generated message
- **Use Case**: When you want a clean, linear target branch history
- **Command**: `git merge --squash`
- **Customization**: Choose any target branch and provide custom commit message

#### Option 3: Only Uncommitted Changes
- **Process**: Stash uncommitted changes and apply to target branch
- **Result**: Transfers work-in-progress without merging commits
- **Use Case**: When you want to move ongoing work to target branch
- **Command**: `git stash` + `git stash apply`
- **Customization**: Select any target branch for applying changes

## Merge Operations in Detail

### Pre-Merge Safety Checks

Before any merge operation, AiderDesk performs several safety checks:

1. **Conflict Detection**: Analyzes potential merge conflicts using `git merge-tree`
2. **Uncommitted Changes Handling**: Safely stashes changes from both worktree and main
3. **State Preservation**: Records commit hashes for potential revert operations

### Merge Process

1. **Stash Management**:
   - Stashes uncommitted changes from worktree
   - Stashes any uncommitted changes from main branch
2. **Rebase**: Rebases worktree onto target branch to incorporate latest changes
3. **Merge**: Performs the selected merge operation (standard or squash)
4. **Restore**: Applies stashed changes back to both branches
5. **Cleanup**: Removes temporary stashes

### Conflict Resolution

If conflicts are detected:

- **Pre-Merge Detection**: AiderDesk identifies potential conflicts before merging
- **Detailed Reporting**: Shows which files conflict and why
- **User Guidance**: Provides clear instructions for manual resolution
- **Safe Abort**: Can abort the operation without losing work

#### AI-Assisted Conflict Resolution

When conflicts occur during merge or rebase operations, AiderDesk offers intelligent conflict resolution:

- **Specialized Agent**: Uses a dedicated Conflict Resolution agent with focused tool permissions
- **Automatic Resolution**: Automatically attempts to resolve conflicted files by analyzing the changes
- **Context-Aware**: The agent considers base, ours, and theirs versions to find optimal solutions
- **Safe Process**: Resolutions are staged for review before continuing the operation
- **Manual Override**: Users can review and modify AI-resolved conflicts before finalizing

## Rebase Operations

AiderDesk provides comprehensive rebase functionality for worktrees, enabling you to synchronize your worktree with any branch before merging:

### Rebase Workflow

1. **Branch Selection**: Choose the source branch to rebase from (default: main branch)
2. **Conflict Detection**: AiderDesk analyzes potential conflicts before rebasing
3. **Rebase Execution**: Performs the rebase operation with detailed progress tracking
4. **Conflict Resolution**: If conflicts arise, use AI-assisted resolution or manual intervention
5. **Completion**: Continue or abort the rebase as needed

### Rebase States

- **In Progress**: Rebase is actively running
- **Conflicts Detected**: Rebase paused due to merge conflicts
- **Ready to Continue**: Conflicts resolved and staged, ready to continue
- **Aborted**: Rebase cancelled, worktree restored to pre-rebase state

### Rebase Controls

- **Rebase from Branch**: Initiate rebase from any branch
- **Continue Rebase**: Resume rebase after conflict resolution
- **Abort Rebase**: Cancel the rebase and restore original state
- **Resolve Conflicts with Agent**: Automatically resolve using AI assistance

### Rebase Benefits

- **Clean History**: Maintains linear commit history
- **Up-to-Date**: Incorporates latest changes from target branch
- **Conflict Isolation**: Handles conflicts in controlled environment
- **Safe Operations**: Full revert capabilities to pre-rebase state

## Revert Operations

AiderDesk provides a safety net with merge revert functionality:

![Revert Button](../images/worktree-revert-button.png)

### How Revert Works

1. **State Tracking**: Each merge operation saves a `MergeState` with pre-merge commit hashes
2. **Revert Process**:
   - Resets target branch to pre-merge state
   - Resets worktree to pre-merge state
   - Restores uncommitted changes in both locations
3. **Selective Cleanup**: Removes merge-related stashes while preserving work

### When to Use Revert

- **Merge Issues**: When merge results are unexpected
- **Testing Changes**: When you want to test a merge and then undo it
- **Accidental Merge**: When changes were merged prematurely
- **Integration Problems**: When merged changes break the main branch

## Advanced Features

### Visual Status Indicators

AiderDesk provides real-time status indicators for worktrees, giving you immediate insight into worktree state:

- **Ahead Commits**: Shows number of commits ahead of target branch (↑ N commits)
- **Uncommitted Files**: Displays count of modified but uncommitted files (N files)
- **Conflict Predictions**: Warns about potential merge conflicts before operations
- **Current Conflicts**: Indicates active merge conflicts needing resolution
- **Rebase Status**: Shows when rebase is in progress or needs attention

These indicators help you:
- Plan merges and rebases more effectively
- Understand worktree state at a glance
- Prevent potential integration issues
- Track progress during complex operations

### Enhanced Branch Management

Worktrees integrate seamlessly with branch operations:

- **Target Branch Selection**: Choose any branch for merge/rebase operations
- **Branch Status Display**: See which branches have associated worktrees
- **Smart Conflict Prediction**: Analyze potential conflicts before operations
- **Branch-Specific Integration**: Tailor integration strategy per branch

### Git Operations

All standard Git operations work within worktrees:

- **Pull/Push**: Sync with remote repositories
- **Commit History**: View and navigate commit history
- **Diff Generation**: Generate diffs for AI analysis
- **Rebase Operations**: Full rebase support with conflict resolution
- **Branch Switching**: Seamlessly switch between branches within worktree

### AI Integration

The AI system works seamlessly with worktrees:

- **Context Awareness**: AI operates within worktree context
- **File Operations**: All file edits happen in the worktree
- **Commit Messages**: AI can generate commit messages based on worktree changes
- **Code Analysis**: AI analyzes code within the worktree isolation

## Best Practices

### When to Use Worktrees

**Ideal for:**

### Conflict Resolution Workflow

1. **Detection**: AiderDesk predicts and identifies conflicts early
2. **Assessment**: Review conflicting files and understand the nature of conflicts
3. **Resolution Options**:
   - **AI-Assisted**: Let the Conflict Resolution agent handle automatic resolution
   - **Manual**: Use traditional Git conflict resolution workflow
   - **Hybrid**: Use AI for initial resolution, then manually refine
4. **Validation**: Review resolved changes before continuing operations
5. **Completion**: Proceed with merge or rebase after conflicts are resolved

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Worktree Creation Fails
- **Cause**: Repository not initialized or no initial commit
- **Solution**: AiderDesk automatically initializes repository and creates initial commit

#### Merge Conflicts
- **Cause**: Divergent changes in same files
- **Solution**: Resolve conflicts manually in worktree, then retry merge

#### Revert Fails
- **Cause**: Merge state not available or corrupted
- **Solution**: Manual reset using Git commands or create new worktree

#### Disk Space
- **Cause**: Multiple worktrees with large file changes
- **Solution**: Regular cleanup of completed worktree tasks

### Recovery Procedures

1. **Manual Git Operations**: Use Git commands directly in worktree directory
2. **Worktree Removal**: Manually remove worktree using `git worktree remove`
3. **State Reset**: Reset main branch using recorded commit hashes
4. **Backup Recovery**: Restore from Git reflog if needed
