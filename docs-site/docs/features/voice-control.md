# Voice Control

Voice Control allows you to use speech-to-text functionality to dictate your prompts directly into the chat input field. This feature provides a hands-free way to interact with AiderDesk, making it easier to input long or complex prompts without typing.

## Supported Providers

Voice control is currently supported with the following AI providers:

- **OpenAI**: Uses OpenAI's real-time speech-to-text API
- **Google Gemini**: Uses Gemini's live audio input capabilities

> **Note**: Only one provider can have voice control enabled at a time. This ensures proper audio stream management and avoids conflicts.

## Enabling Voice Control

### Step 1: Configure a Provider Profile

Voice control uses the provider profile that has **Voice Control** enabled (OpenAI or Gemini).

1. Open the **Model Library** (database icon in the top bar)
2. Select your preferred provider profile (OpenAI or Gemini)
3. Enter your API key in the provider settings
4. Save the configuration

### Step 2: Enable Voice Control (Model Library)

You can enable voice control directly on a provider profile:

1. Open the **Model Library**
2. Select the provider profile you configured in Step 1
3. Find the **Voice Control** section
4. Enable **Voice Control** and save

> **Note**: Only one provider profile can have voice control enabled at a time.

### Step 3: Configure Voice Options (Settings → Voice)

Use **Settings → Voice** for the detailed configuration:

1. Open **Settings**
2. Go to the **Voice** tab
3. Select the **Provider Profile** you want to use for voice control
4. Configure voice options as needed:
   - **Model** (provider-specific)
   - **Microphone** (choose a device or keep **Default**)
   - **Idle timeout** (silence duration before auto-stop; default is 5 seconds)
   - **System instructions** (what the speech-to-text session should expect)
   - OpenAI: **Language**
   - Gemini: **Temperature**

The microphone icon will appear in the chat input when a supported provider profile has voice enabled.

## Using Voice Control

### Starting Voice Recording

Once voice control is enabled, you'll see a microphone icon in the chat input area:

1. Click the microphone icon to start recording
2. Speak clearly into your microphone
3. The audio analyzer will show visual feedback of your voice input
4. Click the microphone icon again to stop recording

### Real-time Transcription

As you speak, the system will transcribe your speech in real-time:

- **Live Transcription**: Text appears as you speak
- **Automatic Silence Detection**: Recording stops automatically after the configured idle timeout (default: 5 seconds)
- **Visual Feedback**: Audio level indicators show when your voice is being detected

### After Recording

Once you stop recording:

1. The transcribed text will appear in the chat input field
2. You can edit the text before sending if needed
3. Press Enter or click Send to submit your prompt

## Technical Implementation

### Audio Processing

The voice control system uses Web Audio API for:

- **Audio Capture**: Accesses microphone through `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()`
- **Audio Processing**: Real-time audio level monitoring and silence detection
- **Format Conversion**: Converts audio to PCM format for provider APIs

### Provider Integration

#### OpenAI Integration
- Uses WebRTC for real-time audio streaming
- Supports OpenAI's real-time speech-to-text API
- Handles audio buffer management and transcription events

#### Gemini Integration  
- Uses Google GenAI SDK for live audio input
- Uses the voice model `gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025` (current default)
- Implements an idle timeout (silence) auto-stop (default: 5 seconds)

### Security and Privacy

- **Local Processing**: Audio is processed locally before being sent to providers
- **Secure Transmission**: All audio data is transmitted using encrypted HTTPS connections
- **No Local Storage**: Audio recordings are not stored locally after transcription
- **Permission Required**: Microphone access requires explicit user permission

## Requirements and Limitations

### System Requirements

- **Microphone**: A working microphone is required
- **Browser Permissions**: Microphone access must be granted
- **Network Connection**: Stable internet connection for provider API communication
- **API Key**: Valid API key for OpenAI or Gemini

### Current Limitations

- **One Provider at a Time**: Only one provider profile can have voice control enabled
- **No Voice Commands**: Voice control only transcribes speech, it doesn't execute voice commands
- **No Audio Playback**: The system doesn't provide text-to-speech capabilities

### Platform Support

- **Desktop**: Full support on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Microphone Access**: Requires microphone permissions on all platforms
- **Electron Security**: Microphone access is properly sandboxed within the application

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Microphone Not Working
1. Check if your microphone is connected and working
2. Verify microphone permissions in your system settings
3. In **Settings → Voice**, try selecting a specific microphone device (instead of **Default**)
4. Ensure no other application is using the microphone
5. Restart the application

#### Voice Control Not Available
1. Verify you have a provider profile configured with a valid API key
2. Open **Settings → Voice** and select a supported provider profile (OpenAI/Gemini)
3. Ensure only one provider profile has voice control enabled
4. Restart the application if changes don't take effect

#### Poor Transcription Quality
1. Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
2. Ensure minimal background noise
3. Check your microphone quality and positioning
4. Try moving closer to the microphone

#### Connection Issues
1. Verify your internet connection is stable
2. Check if your API key is valid and has sufficient credits
3. Ensure the provider's API is operational
4. Try switching to a different provider if available

## Configuration Options

### Audio Settings

The voice control system includes several configurable parameters:

- **Microphone**: Select a specific input device (or keep **Default**)
- **Idle timeout**: Automatically stops recording after a period of silence (default: 5 seconds)

### Provider Settings

Each provider has specific configuration options (available in **Settings → Voice**):

#### OpenAI
- **Model**: `gpt-4o-transcribe` or `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe`
- **Language**: Selectable (default: `en`)
- **System instructions**: Customizable
- **Idle timeout**: Customizable

#### Gemini
- **Model**: `gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025` (current default)
- **Temperature**: Slider from 0 to 1 (default: 0.7)
- **System instructions**: Customizable
- **Idle timeout**: Customizable

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for voice control include:

- **Voice Commands**: Ability to execute commands through voice
- **Multiple Provider Support**: Enable voice control on multiple providers simultaneously
- **Text-to-Speech**: Add audio feedback for system responses
