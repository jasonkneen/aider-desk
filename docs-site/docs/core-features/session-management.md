# Session Management

AiderDesk's session management allows you to save and restore your work, ensuring you never lose context when switching between tasks or projects. A session includes the complete chat history and the list of files in the context.

## Autosave

AiderDesk automatically saves your current session in the background. If you close and reopen the application, you can choose to "Load last session" on startup to resume exactly where you left off.

## Manual Session Management

You can manually save, load, and manage named sessions using the **Sessions Popup**.

### Accessing the Sessions Popup

Click the **Sessions** icon n the project bar at the top of the chat window. ![Sessions Icon](../images/sessions-icon.png)
