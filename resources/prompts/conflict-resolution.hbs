Resolve the Git merge conflicts for the file: {{filePath}}

Available version files:
{{#if basePath}}- BASE version (common ancestor): {{basePath}}{{/if}}
{{#if oursPath}}- OURS version (upstream/target branch): {{oursPath}}{{/if}}
{{#if theirsPath}}- THEIRS version (working/task branch): {{theirsPath}}{{/if}}

IMPORTANT: This is a REBASE operation, so the meanings are swapped:
- OURS = upstream/target branch (what we're rebasing onto)
- THEIRS = working/task branch (what we're rebasing)

Current file status: The main file contains conflict markers that need to be resolved.

Use your tools to:
1. Read the version files to understand what each branch changed
2. Analyze the current file with conflict markers
3. Write the resolved content back to the main file
4. Ensure NO conflict markers remain in the final result

Important: Make decisions that preserve the intent of both branches when possible. The final file should be a clean, working version without any conflict markers.
