# Manual Package Build and Release Workflow

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow named "Manual Package Build and Release" that allows you to manually build the Linux and Windows packages and create a draft GitHub release with these packages.

To trigger this workflow:

1.  Navigate to the **Actions** tab in the GitHub repository.
2.  In the left sidebar, click on the **"Manual Package Build and Release"** workflow.
3.  Above the list of workflow runs, click the **"Run workflow"** button.
4.  You can typically choose the branch to run it on (e.g., `main`).
5.  Click the green **"Run workflow"** button to start the process.

Once completed, a new draft release will be created in the repository's "Releases" section, including the built packages for Linux and Windows.
